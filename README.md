# plutus-plonk-example
This an e2e example of a plonk ZKP written in Circom, besides that, this repo uses a custom fork of SnarkJS to generate proofs. To run this example, enter a shell via `nix develop`, this will bring all the necessary tools in path. The goal of this example is to show that it is not difficult to develop and set up a script that uses zero knowledge on Cardano.

# To verify the code / compile it yourself

### Circom
In the `circom/example.circuit` file you will find the logic of what we prove in zero knowledge. This circuit has two private inputs a and b and one public input c, the idea is that this simple circuit proves that one knows a secret `a` and `b` such that for a public value `c`  we have `c=a*a+b`. To compile this circuit over the BLS12-381 curve to a rank one constraint system (R1CS), you can use
```bash
cd circom
circom example.circuit --r1cs --wasm --sym -p bls12381
cd ..
```
This will create the files and folder
```bash
├── example_js
│   ├── example.wasm
│   ├── generate_witness.js
│   └── witness_calculator.js
├── example.r1cs
└── example.sym
```
Here, the `example.r1cs` can also be converted to a readable form via
```bash
snarkjs r1cs export json circom/example.r1cs circom/example.r1cs.json
```
To view more information on this R1CS, you can use,
```bash
snarkjs r1cs info circom/example.r1cs
```

### The trusted setup (power of tau)
In the `test-vector` directory, you will find the files that SnarkJS uses to convert this R1CS to something we can use to generate proofs. First note that in the `test-vector/setup/` folder, we have the power of tau files (these are generated by me, and are not to be trusted, as this is an example, see the SnarkJS repo for more info). Besides that, the verification key (which is the mapping of the R1CS over the power of tau) is given, to calculate this yourself, you can use,
```bash
snarkjs plonk setup circom/example.r1cs test-vectors/setup/pot_final.ptau test-vectors/setup/example_final.zkey
```
To export this example_final.zkey to the more human-readable verification_key.json, you can use,
```bash
snarkjs zkey export verificationkey test-vectors/setup/example_final.zkey test-vectors/setup/verification_key.json
```
Please note that if you did these steps, no file changed (see git status), showing that the verification key that was in the repo, was the correct one.

### Generate a proof from a witness
In the `test-vector/example` folder, I create a `private-input.json`. This hold the secret values a=3 and b=11 (you can pick different values) which, together with the wasm files generated in the Circom step above, can be used to create a witness via,
```bash
node circom/example_js/generate_witness.js circom/example_js/example.wasm test-vectors/example/private-input.json test-vectors/example/witness.wtns
```
this witness can be used to create a proof and deduce what the public output should be via,
```bash
snarkjs plonk prove test-vectors/setup/example_final.zkey test-vectors/example/witness.wtns test-vectors/example/proof.json test-vectors/example/public-input.json
```
You can verify this proof against the verification key via
```bash
snarkjs plonk verify test-vectors/setup/verification_key.json test-vectors/example/public-input.json test-vectors/example/proof.json
```
### The Cardano side
## Compile the script and create redeemer
In this repo, you will find a plutus library called `plutus-plonk` that implements the verifier logic needed to verify a proof and public input given a fixed verification key. Besides that, there is a basic minting script implemented in the `plutus-scripts` folder that uses this to verify the circuit we compiled and setup above. To compile this script (which hard-codes `test-vectors/setup/verification_key.json` in the minting script) and convert both the `public-input.json` and `proof.json` to plutus data, you can use
```bash
nix run .#plutus-scripts:exe:write-scripts
```
This will write the script to `assets/V3/zkMintingScript.plutus` and the redeemer (which contains the combination of your public input and proof) to `assets/redeemers/mintRedeemer.json`. These two together should allow you to mint an asset with any name under the policy ID via
```bash
cardano-cli conway transaction build --testnet-magic 4 \
 --tx-in $(cardano-cli query utxo --address $(cat payment.addr) --output-json --testnet-magic 42 | jq -r 'keys[0]') \
 --tx-in-collateral $(cardano-cli query utxo --address $(cat payment.addr) --output-json --testnet-magic 42 | jq -r 'keys[0]') \
 --mint "1 $(cardano-cli transaction policyid --script-file assets/V3/zkMintingScript.plutus).eeeeee" \
 --tx-out $(cat payment.addr)+10000000+"1 $(cardano-cli transaction policyid --script-file assets/V3/zkMintingScript.plutus).eeeeee" \
 --change-address $(cat payment.addr) \
 --mint-script-file assets/V3/zkMintingScript.plutus --mint-redeemer-file assets/redeemers/mintRedeemer.json \
 --out-file tx
 ```
which should work on sanchonet, given that the `payment.addr` can cover for the tx.
## Deploy a local testnet
If you would like to test this script on a local testnet, you can deploy one via
```bash
deploy-local-testnet
```
In a new shell (a new `nix develop` terminal), wait for it to make blocks (check when `cardano-cli query tip --testnet-magic 42` works). Then you can mint via
```bash
cp local-testnet/example/utxo-keys/utxo1.skey ./payment.skey
cp local-testnet/example/utxo-keys/utxo1.vkey ./payment.vkey
cardano-cli address build --testnet-magic 42 --payment-verification-key-file payment.vkey > payment.addr
cardano-cli conway transaction build --testnet-magic 42 \
 --tx-in $(cardano-cli query utxo --address $(cat payment.addr) --output-json --testnet-magic 42 | jq -r 'keys[0]') \
 --tx-in-collateral $(cardano-cli query utxo --address $(cat payment.addr) --output-json --testnet-magic 42 | jq -r 'keys[0]') \
 --mint "1 $(cardano-cli transaction policyid --script-file assets/V3/zkMintingScript.plutus).eeeeee" \
 --tx-out $(cat payment.addr)+10000000+"1 $(cardano-cli transaction policyid --script-file assets/V3/zkMintingScript.plutus).eeeeee" \
 --change-address $(cat payment.addr) \
 --mint-script-file assets/V3/zkMintingScript.plutus --mint-redeemer-file assets/redeemers/mintRedeemer.json \
 --out-file tx
cardano-cli transaction sign --testnet-magic 42 --signing-key-file payment.skey --tx-body-file tx --out-file tx.signed
cardano-cli transaction submit --testnet-magic 42 --tx-file tx.signed
```
You can respin the network by purging it first via
```bash
purge-local-testnet
```
followed by
```bash
deploy-local-testnet
```
again.
